<b>Hello everyone, this is my first time making a vscode theme so please go easy on me if there are issues in the project, with that said, the project is something i have been working on for around 3 days now although i had the idea for more than a month now after rewatching Bocchi-the-rock , this is also my first time trying to make and publish an extension for vscode through azure which was weirdly complicated. </b>

**Here are some screenshots of the project:**

## Installation: 
Installation is pretty all you need is updated VS code and you should be good to go!

Go to the extension marketplace and you search "Bocchi the theme" or link this link, 
https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ReadingSteiner.bocchi-the-vscode-theme

Install the theme from there and enjoy your time coding with bocchi.

## Afterword: 
With this project out, i will try to make new themes and extensions every month based on anything i find interesting, maybe i will try to make an extension that puts any character in your editor next!
